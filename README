I place this in a created temp directory of the development version of pymatgen, usually in the top directory.
There used to be a scripts directory I would put it in.
Edit line 123 of pymatgen GUI to point to the location of the cli directory that contains pmg (python material genie). This is
rough code that represent ongoing development of new functionalities.  It has been put up due to requests
on using the VASP/FEFF DOS comparison function.  To use this enter the Materials Project database number for
the structure you are interested in into the Get Structure entry box, for example type mp-19128 for CoO and press the button.
The MP structure should be printed in the text window.  You will have to make sure the MP database entry contains the DOS.
Many do not. Then press the Plot button on the left and select "Compare Occupied DOS with MP database file".  Browse to
locate your FEFF dos files, i.e., ldos00.dat, ldos01.dat etc.  click on the ldos00.dat file and open it.  Hopefully it 
will work and you should see a plot of the DOS comparison and some data printed in the text window.
